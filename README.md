Dungeons Combat is an addon for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that implements the basic idea of Minecraft Dungeons' combat mechanics, featuring top-down camera view with RPG-like movement and Hack and Slash style combat.

**This addon is in development!**

## Features
- Top-down isometric-like camera view
- (In progress) Hack and Slash combat and movement

## Screenshots
Coming soon!

## How to play
After downloading the addon and applying the pack into your world, simply activate the camera by typing `/function dc.on`. You can deactivate it by typing `/function dc.off`.
Holding a compass and sneaking will change the camera position based on the direction the player is looking at.

## Note
This addon focuses on compatibility with other addons and highly-moddable features, so that you can implement it and add contents for your creations. **It's not a 100% complete imitation of Minecraft Dungeons' mechanics.** Many features from the game are absent in this addon, such as weapons, enemies, combat roll and etc. 

_**Warning: This addon contains `player.entity.json`, which might break other animations and/or custom model related addons! You can avoid this by editing other addons' `player.entity.json` file to have Dungeons Combat properties.**_

### Limits
Because of lack of my coding knowledge, some features in Minecraft may not be properly implemented or be unplayable/unusable, such as:
- **Survival**
- **Building**
- Transportations like elytras, boats, minecarts, horses, etc.
- Misc features like enderman aggression
- Movements such as sprinting and swimming (because of how the movements work like)
- Shield blocking
- PVP

## Special Thanks
This is my first time making an addon for Minecraft. I want to say thanks to everyone who helped and supported me, including but not limited to:
- My friends for being such a dear friend
- Bedrock Add-Ons Discord server for encouraging me to learn JavaScripts and actively helping me
- Minecraft Discord server for encouraging me to make this addon 
- r/MinecraftCommands for helping me with learning commands
- Myself for not going insane after making this only with prior JSON knowledge and without any prior knowledge of JavaScripts
- You for recognizing this

## Info
You may:
- Modify, copy and distribute the addon
- Use it privately
  
You probably shouldn't:
- Use it for commercial use (This addon contains Mojang's assets. Refer to Minecraft EULA)
- Claim the pack as your own (i would be sad)
